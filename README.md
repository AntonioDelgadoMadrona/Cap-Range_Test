RANGE_TECHNICAL_TEST_CAP

DEFINITION

For the realization of this project I have done it under a structural and creational design, always trying to encapsulate the code with a defined purpose. 
I have used to assemble the project from scratch (no CLI, no CRA) React, TypeScript, Styled Components, Jest, Testing Library, Webpack, Babel, etc.

FACILITY

RANGE_TECHNICAL_TEST_CAP is developed in React, so for the installation of dependencies it is necessary to have Node.
Once Node is installed, go to the root of the project and run "npm install" to install all the necessary dependencies.

PERFORMANCE

To run the project on port 8000 it is only necessary to go to the root of the project and execute "npm start". 
Automatically opens a window in the default browser and shows the / of the application (if it doesn't open, go to localhost:8000)

TESTING

To launch the tests, go to the root of the project and execute "npm test a" or "npm run test a" in the console. All tests it detects will start.
